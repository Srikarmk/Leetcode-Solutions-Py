Difficulty : Medium 

>Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]  
>>Output: 3

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        count = defaultdict(int)
        
        for x in nums:
            count[x] += 1

        for x, freq in count.items():
            if freq == 1:
                return x
        
        return -1
```
