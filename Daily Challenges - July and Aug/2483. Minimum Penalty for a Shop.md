>You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':  
>
>if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour 
>whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.  
>If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:  
>
>For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.  
>For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.  
>Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.  
>
>Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.

>>Example 1:
>>
>>Input: customers = "YYNY"  
>>Output: 2  
>>Explanation: 
>>- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
>>- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
>>- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
>>- Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
>>- Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
>>Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.

class Solution:
    def bestClosingTime(self, customers: str) -> int:
        n, Y = len(customers), 0
        for i in range(n):
            Y += (1 if customers[i] == 'Y' else 0)
        min_p, hour, y_found, n_found = n, n, 0, 0
        for h in range(n + 1):
            y_remaining = Y - y_found
            pen = y_remaining + n_found
            if pen < min_p:
                hour = h
                min_p = pen
            n_found += (1 if h < n and customers[h] == 'N' else 0)
            y_found += (1 if h < n and customers[h] == 'Y' else 0)
        return hour
