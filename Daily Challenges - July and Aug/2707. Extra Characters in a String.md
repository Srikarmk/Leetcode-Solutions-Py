Difficulty : Medium 

>You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.
>Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.
>>
>>Example 1:  
>> 
>>Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]  
>>Output: 1  
>>Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def minExtraChar(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        word_dict = defaultdict(list)
        for word in dictionary:
            word_dict[word[0]].append(word)
        result = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            result[i] = result[i + 1] + 1
            if s[i] in word_dict:
                for word in word_dict[s[i]]:
                    if s[i:i + len(word)] == word:
                        result[i] = min(result[i], result[i + len(word)])
        return result[0]
```
