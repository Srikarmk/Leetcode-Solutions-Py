>Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]  
>>Output: 1  
>>Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.  



```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        prev = 0
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[prev][1] > intervals[i][0]:
                count += 1
            else:
                prev = i
        
        return count
```
