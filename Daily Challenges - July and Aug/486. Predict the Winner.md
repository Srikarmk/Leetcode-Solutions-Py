Difficulty : Medium 

>You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.
>
>Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.
>
>Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: nums = [1,5,2]  
>>Output: false  
>>Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.   
>>If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).   
>>So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.   
>>Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.


```python
class Solution:
    def score(self, nums, l, r, dp):
        if dp[l][r] != -1:
            return dp[l][r]
        if l == r:
            return nums[l]
        
        left = nums[l] - self.score(nums, l + 1, r, dp)
        right = nums[r] - self.score(nums, l, r - 1, dp)
        dp[l][r] = max(left, right)
        
        return dp[l][r]
    
    def PredictTheWinner(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        return self.score(nums, 0, n - 1, dp) >= 0
