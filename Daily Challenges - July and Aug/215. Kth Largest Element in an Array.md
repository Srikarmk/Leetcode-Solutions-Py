>Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
>
>Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2  
>>Output: 5  


```python

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        p = []
        for x in nums:
            heapq.heappush(p, x)
            if len(p) > k:
                heapq.heappop(p)
        return p[0]
```
