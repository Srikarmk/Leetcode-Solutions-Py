>There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
>
>For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
>Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

>>Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]  
>>Output: true  
>>Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.   
>>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
