Difficultly : Hard 

>There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:  
>
>The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.  
>At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.  
>Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.  
>  
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: s = "aaabbb"  
>>Output: 2  
>>Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".

```python
class Solution:
    def strangePrinter(self, s: str) -> int:
        N = len(s)
        @cache
        def calc(left, right): 
            if left >= right: 
                return 0
            best = calc(left + 1, right) + 1
            for index in range(left + 1, right + 1): 
                if s[left] == s[index]: 
                    best = min(best, calc(left, index - 1) + calc(index, right))
            return best
        return calc(0, N - 1) + 1
