>>Example 1:

>>Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]  
>>Output: 2  
>>Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

```python
class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        count = [1] * n
        maxLen = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                        count[i] = count[j]
                    elif dp[j] + 1 == dp[i]:
                        count[i] += count[j]
                maxLen = max(maxLen, dp[i])

        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if dp[i] == maxLen:
                ans += count[i]

        return ans
