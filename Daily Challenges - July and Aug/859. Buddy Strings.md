>Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.  
>
>Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].  
>
>For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"  
>>Output: true  
>>Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

```python
class Solution:
    def buddyStrings(self, s, goal):
        if len(s) != len(goal):
            return False

        if s == goal:
            count = [0] * 26

            for i in range(len(s)):
                c = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')
                count[c] += 1
                if count[c] == 2:
                    return True

            return False

        index1 = -1
        index2 = -1

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] != goal[i]:
                if index1 == -1:
                    index1 = i
                elif index2 == -1:
                    index2 = i
                else:
                    return False

        if index2 == -1:
            return False

        return s[index1] == goal[index2] and s[index2] == goal[index1]
