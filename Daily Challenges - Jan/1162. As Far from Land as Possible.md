Difficulty : Medium 

Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.


```python 
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        dist = 0
        q = deque()
        drow = [0, -1, 0, 1]
        dcol = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    q.append((i, j))

        if len(q) == n * n:
            return -1
        

        while q:
            size = len(q)
            dist += 1
            for _ in range(size):
               
                r, c = q.popleft()
              
                for i in range(4):
                   
                    nrow, ncol = r + drow[i], c + dcol[i]
                   
                    if 0 <= nrow < n and 0 <= ncol < n and grid[nrow][ncol] == 0:
                       
                        grid[nrow][ncol] = 1
                       
                        q.append((nrow, ncol))
    
        return dist - 1
```
