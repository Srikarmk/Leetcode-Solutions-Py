Difficulty : Easy 
>Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.
>Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        s=s.split()
        return (len(set(pattern))==len(set(s))==len(set(zip_longest(pattern,s))))
```

Notes :   
The string is split inorder to create a string list
Here we take the pattern and remove the duplicates by typecasting it into a set (which in python doesn't accept duplicates).
Similar process is done with the string list s and the zip_longest list aswell.
The lengths are checked and it can be concluded that if all the lengths are equal then there is a similar pattern.
