Difficulty : Easy 

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2


```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Count the number of people this guy is being trusted by.
        beingTrustedBy = defaultdict(int)
        # Count the number of people this guy trusts
        trusting = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Going through the trust relations.
        for a,b in trust:
            trusting[a] += 1
            beingTrustedBy[b] += 1
        
        # The judge trusting 0 people, and being trusted by n-1 people
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if beingTrustedBy[i] == n-1 and trusting[i] == 0:
                return i
        
        # Didn't find a judge
        return -1
```
