Difficulty : Easy 

>You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length. 
>
>The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:  
>
>>abc  
>>bce  
>>cae  
>
>You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.
>
>Return the number of columns that you will delete.

  
  
```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        cnt=0
        for i in range(len(strs[0])):
            for j in range(1,len(strs)):
                if strs[j][i]<strs[j-1][i]:
                    cnt+=1
                    break
        return cnt
```

Notes :  
We need to traverse for the length of one string and then we need to check the columns for every string hence the 2 loops are constructed in such a way.   
  
We can just check the indexe for every column in each string like a matrix and increase count if the sorting is not ascending .
