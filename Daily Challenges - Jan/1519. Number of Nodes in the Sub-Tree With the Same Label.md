Difficulty : Medium 

>You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).
>
>The edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
>
>Return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.
>
>A subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.

>>Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"  
>>Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]  
>>Explanation: Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.  
>>Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).

    def countSubTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], labels: str) -> List[int]:

        tree = defaultdict(list)
        for s,e in edges:
            tree[s].append(e)
            tree[e].append(s)
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        def dfs(node, par):
            nonlocal res
            count = Counter()
            for nei in tree[node]:
                if nei != par:
                    count += dfs(nei, node)
            
            count[labels[node]] += 1
            res[node] = count[labels[node]]
            
            return count
        
        dfs(0,-1)
        return res
