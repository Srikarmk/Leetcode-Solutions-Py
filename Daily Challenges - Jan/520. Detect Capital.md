>We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:  
>
>- All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".  
>- All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".  
>- Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
>    
>Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.  

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        if word.isupper():
            return True
        elif word.islower():
            return True
        elif word[0].isupper() and word[1:len(word)].islower() :
            return True
```

Notes :   

we check 3 conditions , if the string is 
- uppercase or 
- lower case or 
- if the first letter is capital and the slice of the string from 1 to end of the word is lower , then it is true.

else it can be marked as false.
