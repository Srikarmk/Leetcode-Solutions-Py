Difficulty : Hard 

>You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.
>  
>You are given a collection of rods that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.
>  
>Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.
>   
>>Example 1:  
>>  
>>Input: rods = [1,2,3,6]  
>>Output: 6  
>>Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.

```python
class Solution:
    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:
        _sum = sum(rods)
        dp = [-1] * (_sum + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for rod in rods:
            dp_copy = dp[:]

            for i in range(_sum - rod + 1):
                if dp_copy[i] < 0:
                    continue

                dp[i + rod] = max(dp[i + rod], dp_copy[i])
                dp[abs(i - rod)] = max(dp[abs(i - rod)], dp_copy[i] + min(i, rod))

        return dp[0]
```
