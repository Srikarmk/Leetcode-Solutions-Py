Difficulty : Hard 

>You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where locations[i] represents the position of city i. You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
>
>At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
>
>Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including start and finish).
>
>Return the count of all possible routes from start to finish. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5  
>>Output: 4  
>>Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:  
>>1 -> 3  
>>1 -> 2 -> 3  
>>1 -> 4 -> 3  
>>1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
