Difficulty : Easy 

>You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.
>
>It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]  
>>Output: "Sao Paulo"   
>>Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

```python
class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        source_cities = set()
        for path in paths:
            source_cities.add(path[0])
        for path in paths:
            if path[1] not in source_cities:
                return path[1]
```
