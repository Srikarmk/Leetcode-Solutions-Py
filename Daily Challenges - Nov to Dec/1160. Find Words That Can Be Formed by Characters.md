Difficulty : Easy 

>You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.
>
>A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).
>
>Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"  
>>Output: 6  
>>Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

```python
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        def can_form(word, chars):
            char_count = Counter(chars)
            for char in word:
                if char_count[char] <= 0:
                    return False
                char_count[char] -= 1
            return True
        result = 0
        for word in words:
            if can_form(word, chars):
                result += len(word)
        return result
```
