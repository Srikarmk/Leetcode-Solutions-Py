>Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
>
>Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
>
>A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
>
>A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

>For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: s = "aabca"   
>>Output: 3   
>>Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:  
>>- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")  
>>- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")  
>>- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")

```python
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
    
        res = 0
        uniq = set(s)
        
        for c in uniq:
            start = s.find(c) # search a character from the beginning
            end = s.rfind(c) # search a character from the last index
            
            if start < end:
                res += len(set(s[start+1:end]))
        
        return res
