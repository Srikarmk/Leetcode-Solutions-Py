Difficulty : Hard 

>Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
>
>Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.  
>Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.  
>Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.  
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: n = 3  
>>Output: 2  
>>Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".  
>>"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.  
>>"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.

class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        binary = format(n, "b")
        N, res = len(binary), 0
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            if binary[-i] == "1": res = 2**i-1 - res   
        return res
```
