Difficulty : Hard 

>There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The ith crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.
>
>Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most n.
>
>Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]  
>>Output: 2  
>>Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.  
>>In total, there are 2 schemes.

    def profitableSchemes(self, n: int, minProfit: int, group: List[int], profit: List[int]) -> int:
        mod = int(1e9) + 7
        dp = [[0] * (minProfit + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for k in range(1, len(group) + 1):
            g = group[k - 1]
            p = profit[k - 1]
            for i in range(n, g - 1, -1):
                for j in range(minProfit, -1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - g][max(0, j - p)]) % mod
        return sum(dp[i][minProfit] for i in range(n + 1)) % mod
