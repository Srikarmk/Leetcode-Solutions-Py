>Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
>
>Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
>
>Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
>
>Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

>>  
>>Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8  
>>Output: 4

            time = 0
            for pile in piles:
                time += (pile + speed - 1) // speed
            return time <= h
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
