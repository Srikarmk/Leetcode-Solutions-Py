>Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
>
>Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
>
>Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: s = "abacaba"  
>>Output: 4  
>>Explanation:  
>>Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").  
>>It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def partitionString(self, s):
        idx = 0
        count = 0
        mp = {} 
        while idx < len(s):
            if s[idx] in mp: 
                count += 1 
                mp.clear() 
            mp[s[idx]] = True 
            idx += 1 
        return count + 1 
```
