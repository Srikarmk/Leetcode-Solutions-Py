Difficulty : 

>Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.  
>
>You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

>>Example 1:  
>>  
>>Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]  
>>Output: [1,2,3,5]  
>>Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

```python
class Solution:
    def merge_sort(self, nums):
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return nums
        mid = len(nums) // 2
        left = self.merge_sort(nums[:mid])
        right = self.merge_sort(nums[mid:])
        return self.merge(left, right)

    def merge(self, left, right):
        i = j = 0
        merged = []
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] <= right[j]:
                merged.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                merged.append(right[j])
                j += 1
        merged += left[i:]
        merged += right[j:]
        return merged

    def sortArray(self, nums):
        return self.merge_sort(nums)
```
