Difficulty : Hard 

>Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition j - i <= k is satisfied.
>
>A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

>>Input: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2  
>>Output: 37  
>>Explanation: The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].

```python
class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        dq = deque()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums[i] += nums[dq[0]] if dq else 0
            
            while dq and (i - dq[0] >= k or nums[i] >= nums[dq[-1]]):
                dq.pop() if nums[i] >= nums[dq[-1]] else dq.popleft()
                
            if nums[i] > 0:
                dq.append(i)
                
        return max(nums)
```
