>Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.
>
>The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

>>Example 1:
>>
>>Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4  
>>Output: 7  
>>Explanation:  
>>The possible combination ways are:  
>>(1, 1, 1, 1)  
>>(1, 1, 2)  
>>(1, 2, 1)  
>>(1, 3)  
>>(2, 1, 1)  
>>(2, 2)  
>>(3, 1)  
>>Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.   

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the number of combinations to make sum 'i'.
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        
        # There is one way to make sum 0, which is by not selecting any number.
        dp[0] = 1
        
        # Iterate through the possible target sums from 1 to target.
        for currentSum in range(1, target + 1):
            # Iterate through the given numbers in nums.
            for numIndex in range(0, len(nums)):
                currentNum = nums[numIndex]
                # Check if subtracting currentNum from currentSum results in a non-negative value.
                if currentSum - currentNum >= 0:
                    # dp[i] can be achieved by adding the combination count at dp[i - currentNum].
                    dp[currentSum] += dp[currentSum - currentNum]
            
        # The final result is stored in dp[target].
        return dp[target]
```
