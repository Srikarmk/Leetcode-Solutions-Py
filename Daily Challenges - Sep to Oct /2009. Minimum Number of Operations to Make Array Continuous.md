Difficulty : Hard 

>You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can replace any element in nums with any integer.
>
>nums is considered continuous if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
>
>All elements in nums are unique.
>The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in nums equals nums.length - 1.
>For example, nums = [4, 2, 5, 3] is continuous, but nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is not continuous.
>
>Return the minimum number of operations to make nums continuous.
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]  
>>Output: 0  
>>Explanation: nums is already continuous.  

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        ans = n
        hash_set = set()
    
        for x in A:
            hash_set.add(x)
    
        unique = list(hash_set)
        unique.sort()
    
        j = 0
        m = len(unique)
    
        for i in range(m):
            while j < m and unique[j] < unique[i] + n:
                j += 1
            ans = min(ans, n - j + i)
    
        return ans
