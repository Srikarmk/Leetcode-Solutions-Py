Difficulty : Hard 

>Given an integer n, your task is to count how many strings of length n can be formed under the following rules:
>
>Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')  
>Each vowel 'a' may only be followed by an 'e'.  
>Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by an 'a' or an 'i'.  
>Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'.  
>Each vowel 'o' may only be followed by an 'i' or a 'u'.  
>Each vowel 'u' may only be followed by an 'a'.  
>Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.  
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: n = 1  
>>Output: 5  
>>Explanation: All possible strings are: "a", "e", "i" , "o" and "u".  

```python
class Solution:
    def countVowelPermutation(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007

        # Initialize counts for each vowel for length 1
        countA = 1
        countE = 1
        countI = 1
        countO = 1
        countU = 1

        # Iterate from length 1 to n - 1
        for length in range(1, n):
            # Calculate the next counts for each vowel based on the previous counts
            nextCountA = countE
            nextCountE = (countA + countI) % MOD
            nextCountI = (countA + countE + countO + countU) % MOD
            nextCountO = (countI + countU) % MOD
            nextCountU = countA

            # Update the counts with the newly calculated values for the next length
            countA = nextCountA
            countE = nextCountE
            countI = nextCountI
            countO = nextCountO
            countU = nextCountU

        # Calculate the total count of valid strings for length n
        totalCount = (countA + countE + countI + countO + countU) % MOD

        return int(totalCount)
