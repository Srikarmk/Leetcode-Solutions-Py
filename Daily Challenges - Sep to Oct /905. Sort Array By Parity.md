Difficulty : Easy 

>Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.
>
>Return any array that satisfies this condition.

>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]  
>>Output: [2,4,3,1]  
>>Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums[:] = [i for i in nums if i%2==0] + [j for j in nums if j%2!=0]
        return nums
```
