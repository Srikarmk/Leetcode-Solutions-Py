Difficulty : Easy 

>Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
>
>A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

>>Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"  
>>Output: true  

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_idx = t_idx = 0

        while s_idx < len(s) and t_idx < len(t):
            if s[s_idx] == t[t_idx]:
                s_idx += 1
            t_idx += 1
        
        return s_idx == len(s)
```
