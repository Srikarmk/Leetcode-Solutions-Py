Difficulty : Easy 

>Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.
>
>Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"  
>>Output: true  
>>Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        def remove_characters(s):
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                if char == '#' and stack:
                    stack.pop()
                elif char != '#':
                    stack.append(char)
            return stack

        return remove_characters(s) == remove_characters(t)
```
