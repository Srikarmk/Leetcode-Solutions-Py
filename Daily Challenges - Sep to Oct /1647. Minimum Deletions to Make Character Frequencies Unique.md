>A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.
>
>Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.
>
>The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

>>Example 1:    
>>
>>Input: s = "aab"    
>>Output: 0    
>>Explanation: s is already good.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 26 # Create a list to store character frequencies
        
        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1 # Count the frequency of each character
        
        freq.sort() # Sort frequencies in ascending order
        
        del_count = 0 # Initialize the deletion count
        
        for i in range(24, -1, -1):
            if freq[i] == 0:
                break # No more characters with this frequency
            
            if freq[i] >= freq[i + 1]:
                prev = freq[i]
                freq[i] = max(0, freq[i + 1] - 1)
                del_count += prev - freq[i] # Update the deletion count
        
        return del_count # Return the minimum deletions required
```
