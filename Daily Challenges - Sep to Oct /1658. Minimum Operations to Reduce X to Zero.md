>You are given an integer array nums and an integer x. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and subtract its value from x. Note that this modifies the array for future operations.
>
>Return the minimum number of operations to reduce x to exactly 0 if it is possible, otherwise, return -1.
>
>>Example 1:
>>
>>Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3],  x = 5    
>>Output: 2  
>>Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero. 

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total - x
        left = 0
        n = len(nums)
        max_length = -1
        running_sum = 0

        for right in range(n):
            running_sum += nums[right]

            #shrink sliding window to make sure running_sum is not greater than target
            while running_sum > target and left <= right:
                running_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1

            #now we have a avalid sliding window
            if running_sum == target:
                max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        
        return n - max_length if max_length != -1 else -1
```
