Difficulty : Medium 

>You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:
>
>If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
>If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.
>Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.
>
>>Example 1:  
>>
>>Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10  
>>Output: "o"  
>>Explanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".  
>>The 10th letter in the string is "o".

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeAtIndex(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        length = 0
        i = 0
        
        while length < k:
            if s[i].isdigit():
                length *= int(s[i])
            else:
                length += 1
            i += 1
        
        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
            char = s[j]
            if char.isdigit():
                length //= int(char)
                k %= length
            else:
                if k == 0 or k == length:
                    return char
                length -= 1
